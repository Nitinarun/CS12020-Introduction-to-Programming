# ArduinoUniWork-CS12020-
This folder within my Github is a representation of the types of content I have learnt for my CS12020 Introduction to Programming module within my first year. The Files on this repository are the practicals that were conducted throughout Semester 1 whereby we had learnt a variety of skills and developed a deeper understanding on the following topics within Introduction to Programming :

. Describe and explain the types and uses of variables
. Apply abstraction to a design problem, resulting in code that uses functions for separation and reuse of functionality.
. Design and implement programs to solve problems relevant to their degree scheme
. Use third party code and libraries as part of their software solution, and to understand the relevance of software licenses and IPR attribution
